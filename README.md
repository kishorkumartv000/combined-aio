## Tidal NG Downloader (Beta)

This bot features a modern, robust backend for handling Tidal downloads, referred to as "Tidal NG" (Next Generation). It operates by interfacing with a powerful external command-line tool, `tidal-dl-ng`.

### How It Works

Unlike the legacy provider which used a Python library directly, the Tidal NG handler acts as a smart controller for the `tidal-dl-ng` CLI tool. When you request a Tidal download:
1.  The bot determines the correct, isolated directory for the current download task.
2.  It programmatically modifies the `tidal-dl-ng` tool's own `settings.json` file to set the `download_base_path` and any user-specific settings.
3.  It executes the CLI tool (`python cli.py dl <URL>`), which then downloads the music to the location specified by the bot.
4.  After the download is complete or fails, the bot restores the `settings.json` file to its original state to ensure system integrity.

**Note on First Use**: The configuration directory (`/root/.config/tidal_dl_ng/`) and `settings.json` file for the tool are created automatically the first time you use any Tidal NG feature. No manual setup is required.

### Configuration & Settings

The Tidal NG provider is highly configurable directly from the bot's settings menu. All settings are saved on a per-user basis.

-   **Accessing Settings**: Navigate to `/settings` -> `Provider Settings` -> `Tidal NG`. This will open the main settings panel, which is organized into the following sub-menus.

-   **Available Settings**:
    -   **Audio Settings**:
        -   `Audio Quality`: Choose your preferred audio quality (`LOW`, `HIGH`, `LOSSLESS`, `HI_RES_LOSSLESS`).
        -   `Replay Gain`: Toggle whether to write replay gain information to metadata.
    -   **Metadata Settings**:
        -   `Embed Lyrics`: Toggle embedding lyrics into the audio file.
        -   `Save Lyrics File`: Toggle saving lyrics to a separate `.lrc` file.
        -   `Cover Art Dimension`: Choose the resolution for embedded cover art (`320px`, `640px`, `1280px`).
    -   **File Settings**:
        -   `Create .m3u8 Playlist`: Toggle the creation of a `.m3u8` playlist file for albums and playlists.
        -   `Symlink to Track`: Toggle whether to download tracks to a central folder and create symlinks.
    -   **Video Settings**:
        -   `Download Videos`: Toggle whether to download videos at all.
        -   `Convert Videos to MP4`: Toggle automatic conversion of video files to MP4.
        -   `Video Quality`: Choose your preferred video download quality (`360p`, `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`).
    -   **Login/Logout**: Manage your `tidal-dl-ng` session from the main panel.
    -   **Import Config File**: For advanced users, this allows you to upload any configuration file (e.g., `token.json`, `settings.json`) directly into the Tidal NG configuration directories.
        -   **How it works:** When you click the button, the bot will ask you to choose a destination:
            -   **`main config (tidal_dl_ng)`**: Saves the file to `/root/.config/tidal_dl_ng/`. This is the standard directory used by the tool.
            -   **`dev config (tidal_dl_ng-dev)`**: Saves the file to `/root/.config/tidal_dl_ng-dev/`. This can be used for development or testing purposes.
        -   **Note:** If the chosen directory does not exist, the bot will ask for your permission to create it before proceeding. This feature provides a quick way to manage or update any custom configuration files for the `tidal-dl-ng` tool.

-   **Download Path**: To improve reliability, the download path is now managed automatically by the `tidal-dl-ng` tool itself. The bot no longer controls the initial download location. Instead, it asks the tool where the files were saved and processes them from there. All downloaded files are automatically cleaned up after being processed and uploaded.

## Apple Wrapper Controls (Apple Music)

- **Location**: `Settings -> Providers -> Apple Music`
- **Buttons**:
  - `üß© Setup Wrapper`: Starts an interactive setup that asks for your Apple ID username and password, then runs the wrapper setup script with those credentials. If 2FA is required, the bot will detect it and prompt you to send the 2FA code, then continues automatically.
  - `‚èπÔ∏è Stop Wrapper`: Stops any running wrapper process. Includes a confirmation step to prevent accidental taps.

### How Setup Works
1. Tap `üß© Setup Wrapper`.
2. Send your Apple ID username when asked.
3. Send your Apple ID password when asked.
4. The bot runs the setup script with `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` exported in the environment, equivalent to:
   ```bash
   USERNAME="your_username" PASSWORD="your_password" /usr/src/app/downloader/setup_wrapper.sh
   ```
5. If the wrapper requests 2FA, you will see a prompt. Send the 2FA code as a normal message within 3 minutes.
6. On success, you'll get a confirmation. On failure, the last part of the script output is shown for debugging.

### How Stop Works
- Tap `‚èπÔ∏è Stop Wrapper` -> Confirm. The bot runs:
  ```bash
  /usr/src/app/downloader/stop_wrapper.sh
  ```
- It kills wrapper processes and frees ports 10020/20020.

### Configuration
- Override script paths with env vars if needed:
  - `APPLE_WRAPPER_SETUP_PATH` (default `/usr/src/app/downloader/setup_wrapper.sh`)
  - `APPLE_WRAPPER_STOP_PATH` (default `/usr/src/app/downloader/stop_wrapper.sh`)

### Notes & Security
- Credentials are only used to start the setup process and are not stored by the bot.
- You can cancel the flow any time by sending `/cancel`.
- If 2FA prompt does not appear (rare), setup continues and completes automatically.

## Commands and Usage

These commands work in any chat where the bot is present. Copy-paste directly into Telegram.

- /start: Show welcome message
- /help: Show available commands
- /settings: Open settings panel
- /download <url> [--options]: Start a download for a supported provider
This build is Apple Music‚Äìonly. Qobuz, Tidal, and Deezer integrations have been removed. Use Apple Music links like `https://music.apple.com/...`.
  - Examples:
    - ```
/download https://music.apple.com/‚Ä¶
    ```
    - ```
/download --alac-max 192000 https://music.apple.com/‚Ä¶
    ```
    - Reply to a message containing the link and send:
      ```
/download --atmos
      ```
  - On start, the bot replies with a Task ID. Use it to manage the task.
- Queue Mode (sequential downloads/uploads):
  - Turn on: Settings ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Queue Mode: ON
  - While ON, /download does not start immediately; it enqueues and replies with a Queue ID and position.
  - See your queue: use /qqueue (alias /queue) or Settings ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Open Queue Panel
  - Cancel a queued link: /qcancel <queue_id> or use the ‚ùå button in Queue Panel
  - Cancel the currently running job: /cancel <task_id>
- /cancel <task_id>: Cancel a specific running task by its ID
  - Example:
    ```
/cancel ab12cd34
    ```
- /cancel_all: Cancel all your running tasks (download, zipping, uploading)
  - Example:
    ```
/cancel_all
    ```

### What happens on cancel
- The bot stops the active step (downloading, zipping, uploading)
- Any partial files/archives are cleaned up automatically
- The progress message is updated to indicate cancellation

### Realtime system usage in progress
- Progress messages now include CPU, RAM, and Disk usage to help monitor server load while tasks run.

## Apple Music Config (config.yaml) via Telegram
